# Streamlit Web Application

The use case is similar with the Flask Web API Server, we want to serve the Prediction application in the server as a web application so that it will be accessible through the network/internet.

The key differences is with **[Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/)** we can data scripts into sharable fully web apps in minutes. All components can be developed in python,so no front-end experience required.

To install streamlit

```python
pip install streamlit
```

<br>

To run the iris app

```python
streamlit run iris_streamlit_app.py
```
